TODO

- put up a picture when you win?

- a message when you reach an unsolvable state
	- figure out how to determine if a grid is unsolvable 

- different grid types 
	- regular polygons (triangular, hexagonal)
	- non-polygonal tilings
	
- progression system
	- increase grid size (only solvable grids)
	- get the grid to be a letter or number 
	- maybe achievements for reaching a letter or number
